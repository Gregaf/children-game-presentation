# Children Game Presentation

This project is a very basic Unity3D game put together over a couple days. The project was solely
for a presentation to my nephews Pre-K class. The intent of the presentation was to talk about
my career, and how I impact society; so I decided to build a small game in representation of
one of the many fields Software Engineering reaches into. Going for a visually appealing
presentation to engage the class.
